Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise11 into the Arduino IDE. \n  2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED’s 2 through 15 blink on and off in order with a 200ms delay between each, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again…….\n  3. Modify the program so that only LED’s 2-8 blink on and off..\n  4. Modify the program so that LED’s 9-15 blink on and off.\n  5. Modify the program so that only LED’s 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 blink on and off.\n  6. Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise11 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  7. Copy the code into the [Giffer](http://dpengineering.github.io/giffer-reborn/) website\n  8. Enter your  ** _name_**  and  ** _exercise number._**\n  9. Select the  ** _Run and Grade_** button.\n  10. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct ( **Correct**  at lower part of image)\n  11. If it is Correct -  use the ** **Copy Page**  button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  12. Go to  **CL 10.3.11 Upload Completed Exercise10** :  And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise11\n  13. **Click \" **Prepare an answer** \" on NEO\n  14. Click the \" **< >**\" ( _Source code_ ) button.\n  15. Paste by pressing **CTRL + V**\n  16. **Click** \" ** _Save and submit for grading_** \"\n  17. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as:  _YourInitials_Exercise11 -_ in your  _Documents/Arduino/Exercises_  Folder.\n"}
