**In this exercise you will be turning on two LEDs at a time,\nsequencing from bottom to top**.**\n\n**_ACTIVITIES:_**\n\n  1. Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise24 into the Arduino IDE. \n  2. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED’s 2 through 8 blink on and off with a 200ms delay between each, this then repeats four times, then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n  3. Modify the program so that LED’s 2 and 9 blink on and off together, then 3 and 10 together, then 4 and 11 together and so on up through LED’s 8 and 15 together. With a 100ms delay between each. Then repeat this sequence five times. Then the program pauses for 4 seconds and the whole thing starts over again….\n    * Use one for loop for LED’s 2 & 9, 3 & 10, 4 & 11, and so on up through LED’s 8 & 15.\n      * In this for loop try using the math **otherLedNum=ledNum+7;** to turn on the other LED.\n    * Use a second for loop to repeat the entire sequence five times.\n  4. Make Sure you are using variables in your delays. For example: delay(waitTime); instead of delay(100);.\n  5. Save the completed sketch as _YourInitials_Exercise24_ in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n  6. Copy the code into the [Giffer](http://dpengineering.github.io/giffer-reborn/) website\n  7. Enter your  ** _name_**  and  ** _exercise number._**\n  8. Select the  ** _Run and Grade_** button.\n  9. Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct ( **Correct**  at lower part of image)\n  10. If it is Correct -  use the ** **Copy Page**  button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n  11. Go to  **CL 10.3.24 Upload Completed Exercise24** :  And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise24\n  12. **Click \" **Prepare an answer** \" on NEO\n  13. Click the \" **< >**\" ( _Source code_ ) button.\n  14. Paste by pressing **CTRL + V**\n  15. **Click** \" ** _Save and submit for grading_** \"\n  16. If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as:  _YourInitials_Exercise24 -_ in your  _Documents/Arduino/Exercises_  Folder."}
